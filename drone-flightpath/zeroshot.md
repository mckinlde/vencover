Here's a comprehensive plan to approach and implement your drone simulation system:

---

### **1. Project Structure**
Organize your codebase to ensure modularity and extensibility:  

```
drone_simulation/
│
├── main.py           # Entry point for the simulation
├── config.json        # User-defined configuration inputs
├── models/            # Simulation logic and data models  
│   ├── drone.py       # Drone behavior and attributes  
│   ├── environment.py # City environment setup  
│   └── collision.py   # Collision detection logic  
│
├── data/              # Static data files  
│   ├── drones.csv     
│   ├── cities.csv     
│   └── flight_paths.csv  
│
├── utils/             # Helper functions  
│   ├── file_io.py     # Read/parse CSV and JSON  
│   └── visualization.py # Optional visualization  
│
└── README.md          # Documentation on usage
```

---

### **2. Key Components**
#### **Drone Class (drone.py)**
Define drone behavior based on speed, position, size, and path.  

```python
class Drone:
    def __init__(self, name, speed, position, size, destination):
        self.name = name
        self.speed = speed  # Speed in meters per second
        self.position = position  # [x, y, z]
        self.size = size  # [length, width, height]
        self.destination = destination
        self.active = True  # Indicates if flight is ongoing

    def move(self, time_step):
        # Basic movement logic (toward destination)
        if self.active:
            # Update position logic here
            pass
```

#### **Environment Class (environment.py)**
Handles the setup of cities, including weather, buildings, and population density.

```python
class Environment:
    def __init__(self, city_name, dimensions, building_density):
        self.city_name = city_name
        self.dimensions = dimensions
        self.building_density = building_density
```

#### **Collision Detection (collision.py)**
Efficiently detect collisions using spatial algorithms (like KD-Trees or Octrees).

```python
class CollisionDetector:
    def detect_collisions(self, drones):
        # Efficient collision detection in 3D space
        pass
```

---

### **3. Simulation Logic**
Implement the core simulation in `main.py`.

```python
import time
from models.drone import Drone
from models.environment import Environment
from models.collision import CollisionDetector

def run_simulation(config):
    # Initialize drones and environment
    drones = [Drone(...) for drone_data in config["drones"]]
    environment = Environment(...)
    collision_detector = CollisionDetector()

    # Time loop for simulation
    for step in range(0, config["simulation_time"], config["time_step"]):
        # Move drones
        for drone in drones:
            drone.move(config["time_step"])

        # Check for collisions
        collisions = collision_detector.detect_collisions(drones)
        # Log or handle collisions

        time.sleep(config["time_step"])
```

---

### **4. Visualization (Optional)**
Use libraries such as `matplotlib` for simple 3D visualization. 

```python
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

---

### **5. Outputs**
Create detailed reports with:
- Number of collisions, flight success/failure rates.
- Drone travel efficiency metrics.
- Damage assessment based on collisions.

---

### **6. Evaluation Criteria**
Ensure that the simulation meets key requirements:
- **Code Quality:** Maintain clean, modular, and well-documented code.  
- **Collision Detection:** Efficient algorithms for 3D proximity detection.  
- **Simulation Realism:** Accurately model drone dynamics in a city environment.  
- **Visualization (Bonus):** Provide an interactive or static visualization.  
- **Documentation:** Include setup instructions and explanations.
